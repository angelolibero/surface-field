   *
   * Every dot in this field is a pure function of its distance from the
   * focal. That is why the grid reads as perfect and slightly dead: nothing
   * in it belongs to ITSELF. This gives a small minority of the dots one
   * private property , a slow breath that takes them most of the way down to
   * nothing and back , so the field has grain that the light does not
   * explain.
   *
   * THEY DIM, THEY NEVER BRIGHTEN, and that is the whole reason this can be
   * on by default. A dot that lights up on its own competes with the focal,
   * which is the one thing this component exists to say; a dot that steps out
   * for two seconds is just material that is not uniform.
   *
   * WHICH dots is not random per frame but hashed from the cell's own
   * coordinates, so dot 47 breathes at the same rate for the life of the
   * mount and the field has a character instead of a flicker. The hash is
   * taken once per resize and nothing is allocated per frame.
   *
   * THE VALUE IS THE SHARE OF DOTS THAT BREATHE, and 0 is off. It is one
   * number and not a flag plus a density because the two would never be set
   * independently: every caller that turns this on immediately wants to say
   * how much of it, and a flag that only decides whether a second number is
   * read is a flag the reader has to hold in their head.
   *
   * See BREATH_* below for the periods and the depth, and `renderBreath` for
   * why this does not cost the field its sleep.

   *
   * It is a SEPARATE DIAL FROM `breathe` because the two failures it fixes are

   * answers "there are not enough of them"; rate answers "I cannot see the
