   * private property , a slow breath that takes them most of the way down to
   * nothing and back , so the field has grain that the light does not
   * explain.
   *
   * THEY DIM, THEY NEVER BRIGHTEN, and that is the whole reason this can be
   * on by default. A dot that lights up on its own competes with the focal,
   * which is the one thing this component exists to say; a dot that steps out
   * for two seconds is just material that is not uniform.
   *
   * WHICH dots is not random per frame but hashed from the cell's own
   * coordinates, so dot 47 breathes at the same rate for the life of the
   * mount and the field has a character instead of a flicker. The hash is
   * taken once per resize and nothing is allocated per frame.
   *
   * THE VALUE IS THE SHARE OF DOTS THAT BREATHE, and 0 is off. It is one
   * number and not a flag plus a density because the two would never be set
   * independently: every caller that turns this on immediately wants to say
   * how much of it, and a flag that only decides whether a second number is
   * read is a flag the reader has to hold in their head.

       ring each would be a solid wall of crests; one every 250ms spaces them
       150px apart at the default 0.6px/ms, four crest widths, so a long zoom
       reads as a slow pulse of separate rings. A zoom that lasts under 250ms
       is one ring.

       is the neighbourhood of the gesture, and exactly four waves alive at

       The focal WANDERS when no hand is on it: `pickTarget` re-aims it at a
       random point every 2.6s and the focal eases toward it at 0.02, which is
       ~431 frames to cover a canvas , re-aimed 2.8x faster than it can arrive.
       The light therefore never converges BY CONSTRUCTION, and the loop it
       feeds can never rest: ~3,400 dots redrawn sixty times a second, for ever,
       whether or not anybody is in the app.
       .
       So the wander is what the window's focus gates, and not the loop itself.
       Focused, every frame is exactly the frame it was before , drift, chase,
       rings, all of it. Unfocused, nothing re-aims the light and it finishes
       its travel.
       .
       WHAT HAPPENS THEN DEPENDS ON THE BREATH, and only on it. With `breathe`
       at 0 the light arrives, `settled` puts the loop down, and the field
       costs nothing until a hand comes back. With a breath on, the loop stays
       up and goes nearly free instead , that trade is argued at `breathing` in
       `frame`. Either way the LIGHT is still, which is the thing this gate was

         surface is the width of the window by more than half its height:
         780 by 1146 device pixels, 3.58 MB, measured. It also resets the

         AND ON A PHONE IT WAS FIRING THROUGH EVERY SCROLL. Wherever this
         field is sized against the viewport, iOS collapsing and expanding its
         chrome changes this element's height continuously as somebody reads,
         so a buffer of several megabytes was being thrown away and rebuilt
         over and over, for a band whose width never moved.
         .
         SO A HEIGHT THAT MOVES BY LESS THAN THE BAR IS IGNORED. The canvas
         keeps the taller of the two, which is a few rows of dots drawn below
         the fold rather than a reallocation: the cheaper wrong answer by a

       This field is ~3,300 dots on a workspace-sized canvas, and every one of
       them used to pay for `ctx.fillStyle =` plus a freshly built `rgba(...)`
       string, its own `beginPath`, and its own `fill`. Sixty times a second
       that is ~200,000 string allocations per second handed to a colour
       parser and 3,300 separate rasteriser set-ups , for a picture in which
       the large majority of the dots are IDENTICAL to one another.
       .
       A dot outside `focusRadius`, with no crest crossing it, is always the
       same dot: `baseAlpha`, `fg`, `dotBase`. Always. So the far field is not
       thousands of drawing operations, it is ONE: one colour, one path of
       many circles, one fill. Only the dots actually in the light are worth
       touching individually.
       .
       AND IT IS DRAWN STRAIGHT ONTO THE CANVAS, not cached into an offscreen
       one and blitted. That was tried first and it is wrong here, which is
       worth writing down: at `baseAlpha` 0.02 a dot is 5/255, so an
       intermediate 8-bit buffer quantises the antialiased edge twice and the
       faint half of every dot rounds away. The parity harness caught it as
       20,000 changed pixels and a mean alpha that had drifted up , fewer,
       harder dots. Skia rasterises one path of 2,400 disjoint circles at full
       internal precision and composites once, which is the same picture; a
       round trip through 8 bits is not.
       .
       The arithmetic per dot is untouched. Every constant, every smoothstep,
       every clamp is the one that was here before. What changed is how many
       dots need their own draw call, and how many strings get built to say a
       colour that was already said. */

    /* ═══ THE ASYMMETRY, AND WHY IT IS HASHED AND NOT ROLLED ══════════════
       .
       A dot picked at random every frame is noise: it has no identity, the
       eye reads it as the canvas being unstable, and it costs a `Math.random`
       per dot per frame. A dot picked by HASHING ITS OWN COORDINATES is the
       same dot every time the frame is drawn, so it has a period, a phase and
       a place , which is what makes the field feel irregular rather than
       noisy. It also makes the whole thing stateless: `renderBreath` and a
       full `render` compute the identical value for the identical dot without
       sharing anything but the clock.
       .
       HOW MANY IS THE CALLER'S (`breathe`), AND THE DEFAULT IS EVERY DOT.
       .
       THAT IS A CHOSEN MAXIMUM AND NOT A TUNED NUMBER, which is worth saying
       plainly so the next person does not read it as the considered answer:
       the dial was turned to the end on purpose, because what this surface
       wanted was the most intermittence it could have and not the most it
       could get away with , on the DENSITY axis only; the rate stayed at its
       tuned 1. The reasoning below is the reasoning for the LADDER, and it
       still stands: it is what tells you which way to go when this turns out
       to be too much. The quiet setting is 0.2.
       .
       It started at one in eighty, which on a field of fourteen hundred dots
       is fifteen cells with four of them down at any instant , and four
       events on a whole screen is not texture, it is something the eye finds
       ONE AT A TIME, which is the opposite of what this is for. The number
       went up three times in visual trials, and the reading each
       time was the same: THE EFFECT ONLY STOPS BEING A LIST OF INCIDENTS AND
       STARTS BEING A PROPERTY OF THE MATERIAL ONCE THERE ARE TOO MANY OF
       THEM TO COUNT. At 0.2 that field has two hundred and eighty breathing
       and sixty-odd down at any instant, and it is the first setting where
       the eye stops following individual dots and just reads the surface as
       alive.
       .
       WHAT IS ABOVE IT, so the next person turning this knows what they are
       walking into: past roughly one in three the field no longer has a
       resting state to depart from. Everything is always going somewhere,
       the grid reads as UNSTABLE rather than as irregular, and what was grain
       becomes a shimmer , an effect, which is the thing this was built not to
       be. The dial in the lab runs all the way to 1 anyway; that is where you
       go to see the wall rather than to take the number.
       PERIODS ARE SPREAD over four and a half seconds so no two neighbours
       can fall into step and expose the grid again, and the MINIMUM is 4.2s
       because anything quicker stops being a breath and starts being a blink,
       which is a thing the eye is built to catch.
       .
       DEPTH 0.8 AND NOT 1: the dot goes most of the way to nothing and never
       all of it. A dot that reaches zero leaves a HOLE in the lattice, and a
       hole is a shape , the eye finds it and the grid is legible again from
       the gap. A dot at a fifth is merely further away. */
    /* Clamped here and not at the prop, so one bad number cannot make a
       field where every dot breathes or where the maths runs on a negative. */
    const density = Math.min(Math.max(breathe, 0), 1);
    /* Floored well above zero: a rate of 0 would divide the period to infinity
       and freeze every dot wherever its phase happened to put it , some of
       them at nothing. `breathe = 0` is how this is turned off. */
    const rate = Math.min(Math.max(breatheRate, 0.05), 20);
    /* ═══ IT IS AN EVENT, NOT A DRIFT, AND THAT IS WHAT WAS WRONG ════════
       .
       This was built as a BREATH first: 4.2 to 9 seconds a cycle, down to a
       fifth, on a gentle curve. On the bench, beside nothing, it read. On the
       home screen and on the workspace canvas it was INVISIBLE at any density
       , turn the dial to every-dot-breathing and the field still looked
       static , and the reason is not how many there are.
       .
       A dot here peaks at 0.2 alpha: fifty values out of 255 on a dark ground.
       A change that small is read by the eye only if it happens FAST. Take a
       second and a half to fade it and the visual system does what it is built
       to do with slow low-contrast change , it adapts to it and reports
       nothing. The dot was always fading; nobody was ever going to see it.
       .
       So all three numbers move together, and they are one decision:
       .
       · 1.5–4.1s instead of 4.2–9. Fast enough to be an EVENT , something
         that happened , rather than a level that drifted. `breatheRate`
         scales it, and it is the one axis NOT run to the end of its rail:
         4x puts the cycles at 0.4 to 1.0 seconds, and a field at that speed
         has stopped blinking and started strobing.
       · THE SIXTH POWER instead of the third. The dot holds still for most of
         its cycle and the whole excursion lands inside a few tenths of a
         second. That shape is the difference between a dot that is never
         quite itself and a dot that blinks.
       · ALL THE WAY DOWN. The earlier argument for stopping at 0.8 was that a
         dot reaching zero leaves a HOLE, and a hole is a shape the eye can
         find. That argument was right and it was answering the wrong
         question: at this speed the dot is gone for a fraction of a second,
         so there is never a hole to read , there is a blink. A fifth of 50 is
         10/255 and a blink to 10 is not a blink.

    /* ═══ THE COLOUR IS SAID IN 256 WORDS, BECAUSE THE CANVAS ONLY HEARS 256
       .
       Building `rgba(...)` per dot per frame was the whole of this field's
       garbage: a string for every dot drawn, handed to a colour parser and
       dropped, which on a workspace-sized field is enough to bring the major
       collector round in the middle of somebody's click , measured, a
       144ms pause and nine tenths of the main thread.
       .
       WHAT MAKES A CACHE EXACT: Blink quantises a fill colour's alpha to
       EIGHT BITS before anything is rasterised, so every alpha that lands on
       the same byte draws the same pixels, and one string per byte says it.
       Measured on this Electron, dots at dpr 2 on the GPU canvas: ninety
       thousand of them, half placed deliberately next to a rounding
       boundary, and not one channel differs from the string built fresh.
       .
       EXCEPT RIGHT ON THE BOUNDARY, which is why the guard. Where an alpha
       sits within a thousandth of a byte of a half, the parser and
       `Math.round` may round it opposite ways , Blink's own threshold wanders
       by up to 2e-5 of a byte either side of the half, measured , and there
       the string is built exactly as before. That is one dot in five hundred,
       and fifty times the margin the drift needs.
       .
       `globalAlpha` with one constant colour was the other candidate and it
       is NOT the same picture: ~3,600 channels of a 2,400-dot field differ,
       up to 64 levels on a dark ink. Blending a paint alpha is not the same
       arithmetic as parsing one. */

        faint half of every dot rounds away , 20,000 changed pixels and a mean
        alpha drifted upward, measured. Batching the far dots into one path
        instead of one fill each is faster still and also wrong, for the same
        kind of reason: Skia rasterises a path of 2,400 circles differently
        from 2,400 circles, and the difference lands on a fifth of the grain.

         THE LIGHT, once the surface is at full weight now AND was at the last
         paint. At weight 1 `focusAt` gives the pointer's light `1 − w = 0`
         and the cursor push is gated off, so where the hand is changes no

       The loop above goes down the moment the light has arrived, and that is
       not a detail , it is the difference between an ambient texture and a
       rAF running under every screen of the app for ever. A breath drawn the
       obvious way takes that away: something on the canvas is always changing,
       so the frame is always full, so three thousand dots are redrawn sixty
       times a second so that thirty of them can fade.
       .
       So the settled field does NOT redraw itself. It works out the breathing
       CELLS and repaints the ones whose dot actually came out different ,
       which, since a fade only shows when it crosses a byte of alpha, is a
       few hundred even with every dot in the field breathing.
       .
       AND IT RUNS AT 22Hz, NOT 60. This is a five-second fade on a dot 1.6px
       across; the difference between 45ms and 16ms of step is not visible on
       it, and the two thirds of the frames that are skipped are two thirds of

       repaint, the same one a resize pays. What keeps it affordable is WHEN
       it runs. `setViewport` and the prop only record the camera; the frame
       applies the latest one, so a host that sends five camera updates in one
       frame (wheel events arrive faster than vsync) pays for one repaint, and
