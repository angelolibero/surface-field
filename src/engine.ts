/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  THE FIELD WITHOUT A PAGE: EVERY DOT, RING AND BREATH, AND NOT ONE DOM CALL.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * This is the body of `SurfaceField`'s drawing effect, moved here whole so the
 * SAME CODE can run on the main thread or inside a worker on an
 * OffscreenCanvas. It is not a second renderer and must never become one: the
 * two paths look identical because there is only one of these.
 *
 * What it could not take with it is the page. Everything the effect used to
 * reach for on `window` and `document` now comes through `env`:
 *
 *  · `box` and `dpr`, where the canvas sits in the viewport. On the main
 *    thread that is `getBoundingClientRect` at the moment of the call, exactly
 *    as before; in a worker it is the box the host measured when the event it
 *    is handling happened.
 *  · `now`, the clock. A worker has its own `performance` with its own origin,
 *    so the host stamps each event and the worker translates it; a ring
 *    therefore starts at the instant of the press on both paths.
 *  · `readColor` and `readTintHue`, the tokens. A worker has no computed
 *    style; the host resolves them (`dom.ts`) and posts three bytes a colour.
 *  · `sceneOrigin`, where the host's board sits relative to the canvas.
 *  · `frame` and `setTimer`, the loop and the breath's alarm clock.
 *
 * And it hears the page through the methods it returns, which the host
 * (`dom.ts`) calls from the listeners the effect used to hang itself.

     `still` was switching it off purely because it happened to share a
     variable. It does not share one any more: `still` keeps its dead focal
     and gets its breath, and `looping` is what actually decides whether
     there is a frame loop at all.

     Everything the field does around a surface reads two things from this:
     how far a point is from the shape, and which way is out. The clearing
     and the light take the EXACT distance (`gapX`, `gapY`, a vector as long
     as the gap, zero inside). The push takes its own direction and distance
     (`pushNX`, `pushNY`, `pushD`), which differ from the exact ones in one
     place only: a SHARP corner, where the nearest-point direction turns
     with a jump in curvature and folds every line crossing the extension of
     a side. There the 4-norm of the outside distances stands in, whose
     contours are rounded and whose normal turns with zero slope (see
     `selectedPush`). A rounded corner or an ellipse is already smooth and
     pushes along its true normal.
     .
     A TURN IS MEASURED IN THE SHAPE'S OWN FRAME: the point is turned back
     about the centre, measured against an upright shape, and the result
     turned forward again. So a rotated card clears, lights and bends
     exactly like an upright one seen at an angle.

  /* ═══ A LINK IS A CHANNEL, AND ITS MOTION IS THE CLICK'S WAVE ════════════
     .
     Two surfaces that belong together are joined by the dots that lie on the
     path between them, a channel cut out of the field that is already there.
     Nothing is drawn. The channel is LIT AS A SURFACE'S RIM IS, moving or
     not: a link is a fact about two surfaces, not an animation, so its path
     is always there in full light, a line of dots one or two wide joined by
     the fabric's lines, as the dots round a surface are.
     .
     A moving link sends the SAME WAVE A CLICK SENDS, run along the path
     instead of out from a point: a crest of the ripple's own profile, scaled
     down to the channel, whose dots are pushed ahead by `ripplePush`, lifted
     by `rippleBoost` and `rippleGrow` and tinted, exactly as a ring lifts the
     dots it crosses. Its front is not flat: it bows back from the path as a
     ring's arc does, so it reads as a piece of a ring travelling down a
     corridor, and a dot beside the path is pushed out along that arc.
     .
     A gaussian across the path, σ half the width, decides how much of a dot
     belongs to the channel, so a diagonal path picks up the dots nearest to
     it and lets go of the others softly instead of a hard row.
     .
     WHAT IT COSTS. A dot measures a link only inside the link's padded box,
     so a field without links, or a dot far from every one, pays one length
     test, and a still channel's light is kept per dot (see `stillLift`). A
     moving link keeps the loop at 30 wave frames a second, dozing in between,
     and each repaints only the channel's stretch under the crest. */

     seconds, which is the whole of an ordinary drag, and it was measured at
     ~15% of the main thread the drag runs on. The light chasing
     the hand added its neighbourhood on top, every frame.

     lift, glow and push, which at the default settings is a 2.4px shove
     and a crest that brightens without warming the dots into the accent.
     .
     A pinch or a wheel is a stream of camera changes, sixty a second. One
     ring each would be a solid wall of crests; one every 250ms spaces them
     150px apart at the default 0.6px/ms, four crest widths, so a long zoom
     reads as a slow pulse of separate rings. A zoom that lasts under 250ms
     is one ring.
     .
     And a wave fades out over 1s, not over the canvas diagonal as a press
     does (about 3s on a large screen): 600px at the default speed, which
     is the neighbourhood of the gesture, and exactly four waves alive at

     The focal WANDERS when no hand is on it: `pickTarget` re-aims it at a
     random point every 2.6s and the focal eases toward it at 0.02, which is
     ~431 frames to cover a canvas , re-aimed 2.8x faster than it can arrive.
     The light therefore never converges BY CONSTRUCTION, and the loop it
     feeds can never rest: ~3,400 dots redrawn sixty times a second, for ever,
     whether or not anybody is in the app.
     .
     So the wander is what the window's focus gates, and not the loop itself.
     Focused, every frame is exactly the frame it was before , drift, chase,
     rings, all of it. Unfocused, nothing re-aims the light and it finishes
     its travel.
     .
     WHAT HAPPENS THEN DEPENDS ON THE BREATH, and only on it. With `breathe`
     at 0 the light arrives, `settled` puts the loop down, and the field
     costs nothing until a hand comes back. With a breath on, the loop stays
     up and goes nearly free instead , that trade is argued at `breathing` in
     `frame`. Either way the LIGHT is still, which is the thing this gate was
     for.
     .
     NOT `document.hidden`, which is the guard this file already has and which

       backing store away and allocates a new one, and on a phone this
       surface is the width of the window by more than half its height:
       780 by 1146 device pixels, 3.58 MB, measured. It also resets the
       context, so the transform and the colour have to be read again.

       field is sized against the viewport, iOS collapsing and expanding its
       chrome changes this element's height continuously as somebody reads,
       so a buffer of several megabytes was being thrown away and rebuilt
       over and over, for a band whose width never moved.

       SO A HEIGHT THAT MOVES BY LESS THAN THE BAR IS IGNORED. The canvas
       keeps the taller of the two, which is a few rows of dots drawn below
       the fold rather than a reallocation: the cheaper wrong answer by a

  /* ═══ WHAT A FRAME COSTS, AND WHY IT USED TO COST IT THOUSANDS OF TIMES
     .
     This field is ~3,300 dots on a workspace-sized canvas, and every one of
     them used to pay for `ctx.fillStyle =` plus a freshly built `rgba(...)`
     string, its own `beginPath`, and its own `fill`. Sixty times a second
     that is ~200,000 string allocations per second handed to a colour
     parser and 3,300 separate rasteriser set-ups , for a picture in which
     the large majority of the dots are IDENTICAL to one another.
     .
     A dot outside `focusRadius`, with no crest crossing it, is always the
     same dot: `baseAlpha`, `fg`, `dotBase`. Always. So the far field is not
     thousands of drawing operations, it is ONE: one colour, one path of
     many circles, one fill. Only the dots actually in the light are worth
     touching individually.
     .
     AND IT IS DRAWN STRAIGHT ONTO THE CANVAS, not cached into an offscreen
     one and blitted. That was tried first and it is wrong here, which is
     worth writing down: at `baseAlpha` 0.02 a dot is 5/255, so an
     intermediate 8-bit buffer quantises the antialiased edge twice and the
     faint half of every dot rounds away. The parity harness caught it as
     20,000 changed pixels and a mean alpha that had drifted up , fewer,
     harder dots. Skia rasterises one path of 2,400 disjoint circles at full
     internal precision and composites once, which is the same picture; a
     round trip through 8 bits is not.
     .
     The arithmetic per dot is untouched. Every constant, every smoothstep,
     every clamp is the one that was here before. What changed is how many
     dots need their own draw call, and how many strings get built to say a
     colour that was already said. */

  /* ═══ THE ASYMMETRY, AND WHY IT IS HASHED AND NOT ROLLED ══════════════
     .
     A dot picked at random every frame is noise: it has no identity, the
     eye reads it as the canvas being unstable, and it costs a `Math.random`
     per dot per frame. A dot picked by HASHING ITS OWN COORDINATES is the
     same dot every time the frame is drawn, so it has a period, a phase and
     a place , which is what makes the field feel irregular rather than
     noisy. It also makes the whole thing stateless: `renderBreath` and a
     full `render` compute the identical value for the identical dot without
     sharing anything but the clock.
     .
     HOW MANY IS THE CALLER'S (`breathe`), AND THE DEFAULT IS EVERY DOT.
     .
     THAT IS A CHOSEN MAXIMUM AND NOT A TUNED NUMBER, which is worth saying
     plainly so the next person does not read it as the considered answer:
     the dial was turned to the end on purpose, because what this surface
     wanted was the most intermittence it could have and not the most it
     could get away with , on the DENSITY axis only; the rate stayed at its
     tuned 1. The reasoning below is the reasoning for the LADDER, and it
     still stands: it is what tells you which way to go when this turns out
     to be too much. The quiet setting is 0.2.
     .
     It started at one in eighty, which on a field of fourteen hundred dots
     is fifteen cells with four of them down at any instant , and four
     events on a whole screen is not texture, it is something the eye finds
     ONE AT A TIME, which is the opposite of what this is for. The number
     went up three times in visual trials, and the reading each
     time was the same: THE EFFECT ONLY STOPS BEING A LIST OF INCIDENTS AND
     STARTS BEING A PROPERTY OF THE MATERIAL ONCE THERE ARE TOO MANY OF
     THEM TO COUNT. At 0.2 that field has two hundred and eighty breathing
     and sixty-odd down at any instant, and it is the first setting where
     the eye stops following individual dots and just reads the surface as
     alive.
     .
     WHAT IS ABOVE IT, so the next person turning this knows what they are
     walking into: past roughly one in three the field no longer has a
     resting state to depart from. Everything is always going somewhere,
     the grid reads as UNSTABLE rather than as irregular, and what was grain
     becomes a shimmer , an effect, which is the thing this was built not to
     be. The demo's dial runs all the way to 1 anyway; that is where you
     go to see the wall rather than to take the number.
     PERIODS ARE SPREAD over four and a half seconds so no two neighbours
     can fall into step and expose the grid again, and the MINIMUM is 4.2s
     because anything quicker stops being a breath and starts being a blink,
     which is a thing the eye is built to catch.
     .
     DEPTH 0.8 AND NOT 1: the dot goes most of the way to nothing and never
     all of it. A dot that reaches zero leaves a HOLE in the lattice, and a
     hole is a shape , the eye finds it and the grid is legible again from
     the gap. A dot at a fifth is merely further away. */

  /* ═══ IT IS AN EVENT, NOT A DRIFT, AND THAT IS WHAT WAS WRONG ════════
     .
     This was built as a BREATH first: 4.2 to 9 seconds a cycle, down to a
     fifth, on a gentle curve. On the bench, beside nothing, it read. On the
     home screen and on the workspace canvas it was INVISIBLE at any density
     , turn the dial to every-dot-breathing and the field still looked
     static , and the reason is not how many there are.
     .
     A dot here peaks at 0.2 alpha: fifty values out of 255 on a dark ground.
     A change that small is read by the eye only if it happens FAST. Take a
     second and a half to fade it and the visual system does what it is built
     to do with slow low-contrast change , it adapts to it and reports
     nothing. The dot was always fading; nobody was ever going to see it.
     .
     So all three numbers move together, and they are one decision:
     .
     · 1.5–4.1s instead of 4.2–9. Fast enough to be an EVENT , something
       that happened , rather than a level that drifted. `breatheRate`
       scales it, and it is the one axis NOT run to the end of its rail:
       4x puts the cycles at 0.4 to 1.0 seconds, and a field at that speed
       has stopped blinking and started strobing.
     · THE SIXTH POWER instead of the third. The dot holds still for most of
       its cycle and the whole excursion lands inside a few tenths of a
       second. That shape is the difference between a dot that is never
       quite itself and a dot that blinks.
     · ALL THE WAY DOWN. The earlier argument for stopping at 0.8 was that a
       dot reaching zero leaves a HOLE, and a hole is a shape the eye can
       find. That argument was right and it was answering the wrong
       question: at this speed the dot is gone for a fraction of a second,
       so there is never a hole to read , there is a blink. A fifth of 50 is
       10/255 and a blink to 10 is not a blink.
     .
     Under reduced motion none of this runs at all, which matters more now
     than it did: this is the flickering kind of motion, and that is exactly
     what that setting is for. */

  /* ═══ THE COLOUR IS SAID IN 256 WORDS, BECAUSE THE CANVAS ONLY HEARS 256
     .
     Building `rgba(...)` per dot per frame was the whole of this field's
     garbage: a string for every dot drawn, handed to a colour parser and
     dropped, which on a workspace-sized field is enough to bring the major
     collector round in the middle of somebody's click , measured, a
     144ms pause and nine tenths of the main thread.
     .
     WHAT MAKES A CACHE EXACT: Blink quantises a fill colour's alpha to
     EIGHT BITS before anything is rasterised, so every alpha that lands on
     the same byte draws the same pixels, and one string per byte says it.
     Measured in Chromium, dots at dpr 2 on the GPU canvas: ninety
     thousand of them, half placed deliberately next to a rounding
     boundary, and not one channel differs from the string built fresh.
     .
     EXCEPT RIGHT ON THE BOUNDARY, which is why the guard. Where an alpha
     sits within a thousandth of a byte of a half, the parser and
     `Math.round` may round it opposite ways , Blink's own threshold wanders
     by up to 2e-5 of a byte either side of the half, measured , and there
     the string is built exactly as before. That is one dot in five hundred,
     and fifty times the margin the drift needs.
     .
     `globalAlpha` with one constant colour was the other candidate and it
     is NOT the same picture: ~3,600 channels of a 2,400-dot field differ,
     up to 64 levels on a dark ink. Blending a paint alpha is not the same
     arithmetic as parsing one. */

      faint half of every dot rounds away , 20,000 changed pixels and a mean

      instead of one fill each is faster still and also wrong, for the same
      kind of reason: Skia rasterises a path of 2,400 circles differently
      from 2,400 circles, and the difference lands on a fifth of the grain.

       THE LIGHT, once the surface is at full weight now AND was at the last
       paint. At weight 1 `focusAt` gives the pointer's light `1 − w = 0`
       and the cursor push is gated off, so where the hand is changes no
       dot; and the frame that reached 1 had already swept the light out.

     The loop above goes down the moment the light has arrived, and that is
     not a detail , it is the difference between an ambient texture and a
     rAF running under every screen of the app for ever. A breath drawn the
     obvious way takes that away: something on the canvas is always changing,
     so the frame is always full, so three thousand dots are redrawn sixty
     times a second so that thirty of them can fade.
     .
     So the settled field does NOT redraw itself. It works out the breathing
     CELLS and repaints the ones whose dot actually came out different ,
     which, since a fade only shows when it crosses a byte of alpha, is a
     few hundred even with every dot in the field breathing.
     .
     AND IT RUNS AT 22Hz, NOT 60. This is a five-second fade on a dot 1.6px
     across; the difference between 45ms and 16ms of step is not visible on
     it, and the two thirds of the frames that are skipped are two thirds of

     the spacing, so no part of the canvas is still right: this is a full
     repaint, the same one a resize pays. What keeps it affordable is WHEN
     it runs. `setViewport` and the prop only record the camera; the frame
     applies the latest one, so a host that sends five camera updates in one

     A canvas drawn on every frame is a pipeline: the picture on screen, the
     one being drawn, the ones the compositor has not handed back yet. The
     browser keeps those buffers for the next burst and DOES NOT GIVE THEM
     BACK WHEN THE DRAWING STOPS, not in a quarter of a minute, measured. At
     workspace size that is one live and four cached 2130 by 1698 textures
     per canvas, fourteen megabytes each: 138 MB for the dots and the fabric
     of a field nobody is touching, and as much again in the GPU process.
     .
     A NEW SIZE IS THE ONE HANDLE A PAGE HAS ON THEM. Writing the same width
     back keeps the old backing store, measured; a different one throws it
     away with every buffer it had cached. So the width goes one pixel wide
     and back, two resets and no allocation between them.
     .
     AND THE PICTURE IS CARRIED ACROSS, NOT DRAWN AGAIN. A frame built by
     `sweep` is not bit for bit the frame `render` builds from the same
     state: a cell is only repainted when its dot comes out different, so a
     change under one step of alpha stays as it was drawn, and a from-scratch
     repaint moves those pixels by one. Measured on the worker path, 246
     pixels of 3.6 million. A trim is not allowed to move one, so the canvas
     is copied into a scratch canvas first and copied back 1:1 with `copy`,
     which is the old texture exactly, and every box the next partial frame
     trusts stays true. Where there is no OffscreenCanvas to copy through it
     falls back to `render`, the repaint a resize already makes.
     .
     AFTER TRIM_IDLE_MS WITH NO PAINT, AND ONLY THEN. A burst grows the pipe
     back to five within a few frames, so a trim between two gestures of the
     same task buys nothing and costs two copies plus the reallocation; four
     seconds is longer than the pause between two moves of one hand, and the
     memory it waits on was held for ever before. A field that breathes
     paints every 45 ms and never gets here: its pipe is in use. A carry is

     the rest: the lost area stayed dark, and a dot came back only where the
     hand passed, in the staircase of the boxes it swept.
     .
     So a restore is a resize without the reallocation: the transform and
     the cached fill come back with the fresh state, and one full paint puts
     every dot back. The listeners cost nothing while nothing is lost, and
